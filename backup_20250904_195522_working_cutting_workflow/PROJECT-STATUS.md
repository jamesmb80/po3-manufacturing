## 🎯 Project Overview

**PO3 (Process Order Version 3)** is a production planning system for manufacturing operations, replacing a legacy Magento system. The application enables material controllers to efficiently manage part cutting operations across multiple machines (Saw, Router, Laser).

   - Performance: < 500ms load time

2. ✅ **Filter Parts** (US-002)
   - Date range filters (cutting date)
   - Multi-select material filter
   - Order status filter
   - Real-time filter application
   - Clear all filters functionality

3. ✅ **Select Parts** (US-003)
   - Individual checkbox selection
   - Select all on current page
   - Selection count display
   - Bulk actions enabled

4. ✅ **Assign Parts to Machines** (US-004)
   - Send to Saw/Router/Laser buttons
   - Confirmation dialog before assignment
   - Real-time state updates
   - Parts move between tabs correctly

5. ✅ **View Machine Assignments** (US-005)
   - Four tabs: Ready to Cut, Saw, Router, Laser
   - Part counts in tab labels
   - Persistent assignments in session

### Advanced Features (Completed Beyond MVP)
6. ✅ **Advanced Filtering**
   - Type filter (with "None" handling for nulls)
   - Thickness filter
   - Tags filter (comma-separated parsing)
   - All filters work with AND logic

7. ✅ **Smart Filter Validation** 
   - Cascading filter logic implemented
   - Invalid combinations are disabled
   - Real-time recalculation as filters change
   - Prevents dead-end filter selections

8. ✅ **Advanced Sorting**
   - All columns are sortable
   - Custom date sorting for "01 Sep 2025" format
   - Proper numeric sorting for dimensions
   - Maintains sort on filter changes

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

### Current Dev Server
- Running on port 3000
- Hot reload enabled
- No current errors

## 🔄 BMad Methodology Notes

### Current Phase
**Phase 2 COMPLETED** - Core Features implemented with advanced capabilities

### Development Approach
- Iterative development with short cycles
- User feedback incorporated quickly
- MVP-first with progressive enhancement
- Focus on working software over documentation

### Key Decisions Made
1. Used local JSON data instead of API initially
2. Implemented smart filters early (user request)
3. Kept UI simple and table-focused
4. Prioritized performance with memoization

---

## 💡 Tips for Next Agent

1. **Context Preservation**: The smart filter logic in `lib/filter-utils.ts` is complex but well-tested. Avoid refactoring without understanding the cascading logic.

2. **Performance**: Current implementation handles 100 parts smoothly. Test with 500+ parts before adding virtual scrolling.

3. **User Preferences**: User prefers:
   - Simple, iterative improvements
   - One question at a time
   - Working code over extensive planning
   - Table-based UI (like Google Sheets)

4. **Testing Data**: Use `order_data_table.json` for all testing. It has good variety in all fields.

5. **State Management**: Currently using React useState. Zustand is in package.json if needed for more complex state.

---

## 📝 Final Notes

The MVP is fully functional with advanced features. The smart filter validation is a key differentiator that prevents user frustration. The codebase is clean, well-structured, and ready for the next phase of development.

**Recommended Priority**: Focus on UI polish and error handling before adding new features. The core functionality is solid.
