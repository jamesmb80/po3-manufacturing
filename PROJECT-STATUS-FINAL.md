## ✅ Completed Implementation (January 4, 2025)

### Phase 1: Core Workflow Enhancement
1. **Data Structure Updates**
   - Renamed `status` → `order_status` (preserves original Magento status)
   - Added `processing_status` field with 11 possible states
   - Added `completed_processes` array for tracking
   - Added `next_process` field for smart routing

2. **Workflow Routing Engine** (`lib/workflow-engine.ts`)
   - Smart tag-based routing (Banding, Lacquered tags)
   - Configurable process sequences
   - Automatic next-destination calculation
   - Reject/recut handling

3. **Admin Panel** (`/admin`)
   - Drag-and-drop process sequence configuration
   - Custom routing rules for tag combinations
   - LocalStorage persistence
   - Real-time configuration updates

### Phase 2: Dashboard Views (11 Total)
- **Cutting Workflow**: Ready to Cut, Assigned (×3), Cutting (×3)
- **Processing Stages**: Parts to Edge Band, Parts to Lacquer
- **Final Stages**: Ready to Pack, Recuts

### Phase 3: Operator Stations
5 dedicated operator station views created:
- `/operator/saw`
- `/operator/router`
- `/operator/laser`
- `/operator/edge-bander`
- `/operator/lacquering`

Each station features:
- Minimal UI for production floor use
- Process Complete/Reject buttons
- Real-time sync with main dashboard
- Auto-refresh capability

### Phase 4: Critical Fixes 
1. **Fixed Next.js 15 params error** - Made operator station component async
2. **Fixed data persistence** - App now loads from localStorage first
3. **Added real-time sync** - Storage event listeners for cross-window updates
4. **Added Processing Status column** - Visual badges for all workflow stages
5. **Improved operator station access** - Dropdown menu for individual station opening

### Phase 5: UI Enhancements (January 5, 2025)
1. **Collapsible Filter Panel**
   - Master accordion control for entire filter section
   - Starts collapsed for cleaner initial view
   - Individual sections also collapsible within main accordion
   - Active filter badges visible even when collapsed

2. **Improved Tab Bar Organization**
   - Visual grouping with subtle borders between machine groups
   - Color-coded active states (solid colors with white text)
   - Responsive design with abbreviated labels on mobile
   - Added icons to Ready (scissors), Pack (package), and Recuts (rotate)
   - Smaller, cleaner font sizes with better spacing

3. **Visual Polish**
   - Better use of shadows and borders
   - Improved color contrast for active states
   - Smooth transitions on interactive elements
   - More professional, production-ready appearance

## 📊 Current Workflow Logic

### Routing Rules (Configurable via Admin)
- **No tags** → Ready to Pack
- **"Banding" tag** → Edge Band → Ready to Pack
- **"Lacquered" tag** → Lacquer → Ready to Pack
- **Both tags** → Edge Band → Lacquer → Ready to Pack
- **Rejected parts** → Recuts

### Processing Status Values
- `ready_to_cut` - Initial state
- `assigned_to_[machine]` - Assigned but not cutting
- `cutting_[machine]` - Currently being cut
- `parts_to_edge_band` - Awaiting edge banding
- `parts_to_lacquer` - Awaiting lacquering
- `ready_to_pack` - Complete and ready for packing
- `recuts` - Failed/rejected parts

## 🚀 How to Use the System

### Starting the Application
```bash
# The app is currently running on port 3001
# Access at: http://localhost:3001

# If you need to restart:
npm run dev
```

### Key Features
1. **Reset Data Button** - Clears localStorage and reloads sample data
2. **Admin Panel** - Configure workflow sequences and routing rules
3. **Operator Stations Dropdown** - Open individual station views
4. **Real-time Sync** - Changes in any window update all others immediately
5. **Data Persistence** - Survives page refreshes

### Testing the Workflow
1. Click "Reset Data" to start fresh
2. Select parts and assign to machines
3. Move through cutting process
4. Click "Cut Complete" - parts route based on tags
5. Open operator stations to simulate production floor
6. Process parts through Edge Band/Lacquer as needed
7. Parts eventually reach "Ready to Pack"

## 🔑 Important Notes

1. **Current Port**: Application runs on **http://localhost:3001**
2. **Data Storage**: Uses localStorage (clears with "Reset Data" button)
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Tested on Chrome, should work on all modern browsers
4. **Sample Data**: Includes parts with Banding/Lacquered tags for testing
