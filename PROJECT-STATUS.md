## 🎯 Project Overview

**PO3 (Process Order Version 3)** is a production planning system for manufacturing operations, replacing a legacy Magento system. The application enables material controllers to efficiently manage part cutting operations across multiple machines (Saw, Router, Laser).

**Current Status**: ✅ **MVP COMPLETE WITH CUTTING WORKFLOW**

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core MVP Requirements (All Completed)
1. ✅ **View Ready to Cut Parts** (US-001)
   - Table displays all unassigned parts
   - Shows all required fields (Part ID, Order ID, Material, etc.)
   - Pagination implemented with 10 rows per page
   - Performance: < 500ms load time

2. ✅ **Filter Parts** (US-002)
   - Date range filters (cutting date)
   - Multi-select material filter
   - Order status filter
   - Real-time filter application
   - Clear all filters functionality

3. ✅ **Select Parts** (US-003)
   - Individual checkbox selection
   - Select all on current page
   - Selection count display
   - Bulk actions enabled

4. ✅ **Assign Parts to Machines** (US-004)
   - Send to Saw/Router/Laser buttons
   - Confirmation dialog before assignment
   - Real-time state updates
   - Parts move between tabs correctly

5. ✅ **View Machine Assignments** (US-005)
   - Four tabs: Ready to Cut, Saw, Router, Laser
   - Part counts in tab labels
   - Persistent assignments in session

### Advanced Features (Completed Beyond MVP)
6. ✅ **Advanced Filtering**
   - Type filter (with "None" handling for nulls)
   - Thickness filter
   - Tags filter (comma-separated parsing)
   - All filters work with AND logic

7. ✅ **Smart Filter Validation**

9. ✅ **Multi-Stage Cutting Workflow** (Implemented 2025-01-04)
   - Three-stage workflow: Ready to Cut → Assigned [Machine] → Cutting [Machine]
   - Parts can only be assigned to one machine at a time
   - Bi-directional movement (parts can step back to previous states)
   - 7 distinct views (Ready + 2 per machine)
   - Context-aware action buttons based on current state

10. ✅ **CSV Export Functionality**
    - Automatic CSV export when moving parts to "Cutting" status
    - Filename format: `cutting_[machine]_[timestamp].csv`
    - Includes all relevant part information
    - Auto-downloads without user intervention

11. ✅ **Enhanced Status Tracking**
    - Added `cutting_status` field to track 'assigned' vs 'cutting' states
    - Visual status badges in tables
    - Color-coded tabs (Blue: Ready, Yellow: Assigned, Green: Cutting)
    - Real-time part counts in each tab

## 🔄 BMad Methodology Notes

### Current Phase
**Phase 3 IN PROGRESS** - Cutting workflow implemented, moving toward production features

### Development Approach
- Iterative development with short cycles
- User feedback incorporated quickly
- MVP-first with progressive enhancement
- Focus on working software over documentation

### Key Decisions Made
1. Used local JSON data instead of API initially
2. Implemented smart filters early (user request)
3. Kept UI simple and table-focused
4. Prioritized performance with memoization
5. Created backup system without Git for rollback capability
6. Implemented CSV export with auto-download on state transition

## 💡 Tips for Next Agent

1. **Context Preservation**: The smart filter logic in `lib/filter-utils.ts` is complex but well-tested. Avoid refactoring without understanding the cascading logic.

2. **Performance**: Current implementation handles 100 parts smoothly. Test with 500+ parts before adding virtual scrolling.

3. **User Preferences**: User prefers:
   - Simple, iterative improvements
   - One question at a time
   - Working code over extensive planning
   - Table-based UI (like Google Sheets)

4. **Testing Data**: Use `order_data_table.json` for all testing. It has good variety in all fields.

5. **State Management**: Currently using React useState. Zustand is in package.json if needed for more complex state.

## 📝 Final Notes

The MVP is fully functional with a complete cutting workflow implementation. The system now supports the full journey from "Ready to Cut" through "Assigned" to "Cutting" status, with CSV exports and bi-directional movement. The smart filter validation remains a key differentiator. The codebase is clean, well-structured, and ready for the next phase.

**Recommended Priority**: Complete the workflow by adding "Complete" status and consider multi-user support preparation. The cutting workflow is solid and has been backed up for safety.
